<h3> What is TypeScript ?</h3>
<p>Typescript is a superset of javascript language and in other words it is a strongly typed, object oriented, compiled  programming language that is built on javascript.
It allows developers to catch errors during development and enhance code maintainability. 
Superset basically means everything can be done using typescript which we can do with javascript with much more precise manner so that code throws less error at runtime.

<h3>Data types in Typescript ?</h3>
<p>	
There are two types of data types in typescript

<ol><li> <b> Built-in data type </b>
String: It represents a text value like “frontendDevelopment”, or "Angular and React Developer".
Number: It represents the numbered values i.e. 2, 28, 99, etc.
Boolean: It stores true or false values.
Null: An empty value deliberately assigned to a variable.
Undefined: Represents a variable that is declared but not initialized.
any: Represents any value of any data type and any number of values of   different data types.
void: Used to represent that a particular function is not going to return any value of any data type.
</li>
<li>
<b>User defined data type</b>
arrays: In typescript, arrays are used to store the multiple values of any kind of data type.
enums: A special class that specifies the constant variables.
classes: Used to store different data type values in the form of key-value pairs.
Interface: These represent the basic syntax and blueprint that an entity must adhere to.
